# Machine Learning Crash Course

This repository should hold my code for the Google's Machine Learning Crash Course -- at https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/

The crash course was intended to use their own environment, called playground, which provides us the ability to exercise machine learning using python and Tensor Flow through the web browser. However, since there are bindings for Rust of Tensor Flow, I figured I should definitely do it in Rust!

So, here we are.
